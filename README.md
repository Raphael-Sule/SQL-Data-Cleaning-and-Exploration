# SQL-Data-Cleaning
This project aims to clean and process data on layoffs in companies worldwide.
The data includes details such as company names, industries, locations, layoff dates, and layoff numbers.
The objective is to transform this raw data into a structured, usable format for further analysis and visualization.

In the analysis stage, this project aims to:
- Inspect data types, and identify any conversions that need occur.
- Summarize data, like layoff counts and total layoff distribution across companies and industries.
- Analyse time trends, to see if certain periods have higher layoff counts.
